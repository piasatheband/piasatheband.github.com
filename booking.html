<h2>Booking Information</h2>
<p>
Want us to play a show? Just send an email to &lt;&#98;o&#111;ki&#110;g&#64;piasa&#116;&#104;&#101;band&#x2e;com&gt;.<p>
</p>
<h2>Considerations</h2>
<p>
<b>Pricing:</b> While we typically request $100 per hour of performance, Piasa has also played a number of door-split shows and is willing to do so in the future.
</p>
<p>
<b>Set Length:</b> Piasa can fill time slots of up to 4 hours in length and has no minimum time requirements.
</p>
<p>
<b>Material:</b> Piasa primarily focuses on original material. Covers of songs from bands such as <a href="http://www.radiohead.com/" target="_blank">Radiohead</a>, <a href="http://www.deathcabforcutie.com/" target="_blank">Death Cab for Cutie</a>, and <a href="http://www.wilcoworld.net" target="_blank">Wilco</a> (among others) often make it into the live rotation as well.
</p>
<p>
<b>Equipment:</b> Piasa has everything needed to put on a great show. Besides instruments, the band owns microphones, a PA system, and a sixteen channel mixer. Stage lighting has not yet been acquired.
